## Overview

Dynamic Streamlit Data Science Project is designed to streamline the process of data analysis and machine learning model development. The web application built with Streamlit allows users to select from various datasets, choose classifiers, and tune hyperparameters without writing extensive code. It facilitates interactive data exploration, model training, and evaluation, making it suitable for both beginners and experienced data scientists.

## Features

- **Dynamic Dataset Selection**: Choose from multiple datasets, including Breast Cancer, for analysis.
- **Model Selection**: Select classifiers such as KNN, SVM, or Naive Bayes to build predictive models.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Utilize GridSearchCV for hyperparameter optimization and improved model performance.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Explore data insights through interactive plots, heatmaps, and scatter plots.
- **Easy-to-Use Interface**: Navigate through the web application with a user-friendly interface and intuitive controls.
